# What is "Paralyte Services"?

Paralyte Services is a service that provides Discord setups for you and your friends. We aim to help as many people as we can to give them the best possible Discord server we could provide. Our job is to create simple, or advance Discord servers.

[EDIT THIS]

## Why do we do this?

We do this because we enjoy helping others and succeeding in certain things. A lot of people are unsure on how to create Discord servers and this is why Paralyte Services have come together to help the people in need.
